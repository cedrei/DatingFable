Hero: Alright, Ultimate Blinding Light of Destiny? Check. Baltael's Aventail? Check. Slimy necklace? Eww, check.
Hero: Today is the day, I will finally beat that stupid giant cat. 'Mega Meowphant.'
Hero: If I can just not get stuned, for once, and out damage it, I can beat it.
Hero: And get a nice new belt.
Hero: I want that belt.

Time-Hero: Ready for the next challenge, {playername}?

Hero: Going to fight the Mega Meowphant. I think I've got the firepower to beat it.

Time-Hero: Good, good, try not to die again this time.

Hero: Wait, what, DIE?!?

Time-Hero: Enjoy!

Narrator: *The Inn fades into the blackness, the walls bluring and becoming part of the infinite abyss. The floor morphed below {his} feet, becoming transparent as the arena took form. From above, the simmulation took shape, the lines of reality flowing and weaving into a comprehensible form. Then, from beyond the darkness, a mighty roar was heard.*

Hero: Here we go, here we go, here we go. Here I am! Okay, shield up, let's do this.

Narrator: *The beast roared as it charged from the shadows. It hurtled, a bullet of sheer mass towards The Hero. Bracing for the impact, The Hero stood ready to tank the blow.*
Narrator: *However, right in the moment before the beast would collide, it slowed, it's movements becoming fractured and laboured. It froze, a hair's breadth from the face of The Hero, close enough to smell the blood in its breath. And to see the immaculate, jeweled pink in the depths of its eyes.*

Hero: What the- What are those?

Narrator: *Then, as if nothing had happened at all, the beast collided with The Hero. Blackness overtook {him} as {his} body was sent hurtling into the abyss.*


Narrator: Hey Dev team, get Dove's theme to play here

Dove: Hey there Sunshine


Narrator: *The Hero awakes to find {himself} sitting on a bar stool, staring into the deep aqua eyes of none other than Dove. But all is not as it seems :lennythink:*
